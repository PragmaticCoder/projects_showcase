## Showcase

Showcase of past and ongoing my personal projects.

## Motivation

> “Every canvas is a journey all its own.”
> **– Helen Frankenthaler**

Programing is like painting, what you don’t paint is as important as what you do. I like expressing my imagination through code, while trying to capture the smallest details, carefully choosing the right tech stack/framework, and preserving the art in it's purest form in a iterative agile fashion.

## 1. Django Test Sample
